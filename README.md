# Four-bit-ALU
Overview:
The 4-Bit ALU is a fundamental component in digital circuit design, responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations on 4-bit binary numbers. It plays a crucial role in microprocessor and CPU architectures, executing operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR.

Features:
4-Bit Operations: The ALU processes 4-bit binary inputs, allowing for a range of mathematical and logical computations.

Arithmetic Operations: Performs addition and subtraction operations on binary numbers, enabling basic arithmetic calculations.

Logic Operations: Executes logical operations, including AND, OR, and XOR, providing the capability to manipulate and analyze binary data.

Flags: Generates flags such as zero flag, carry flag, and overflow flag, indicating the outcome of arithmetic operations and aiding in control flow.

Implementation:
The 4-Bit ALU is typically implemented using digital logic gates, flip-flops, and other combinational logic components. It follows a modular design, allowing for easy integration into larger digital systems.
